# Explaining the Display

![](Display.png)

Each page in the program has some consistent elements:

## Home Button

![](Display1.png)

The picture in the upper lefthand corner will return you to the Main Menu.

When a particular piece is selected, it's picture will be the one shown.

## Feature Buttons

![](Display2.png)

These are specific to each page, but commonly include 
* _Help_ page-specific help
* _Find_ full text search
* _Photo_ to add a picture to the selected piece, or a picture that you then select the target.

## Info Bar

![](Display3.png)

Information about the database as a whole, of the selected piece.

## Work Area

![](Display33.png)

Varies with each page, but can be:
* Navigation buttons
* Display/Edit fields
* Lists

## Network Status

![](Display4.png)

Shows the user name, and what current network activity is occuring. (Usually _quiescent_). Click on sync status to see the error log.

Note that data is saved locally. It is also sent to the server (and vise versa) periodically. 

## Thumbnail buttons / Images

For pieces with a picture, the thumbnail is a fast way to click and select the piece. You can then inspect and edit data on that piece.

When a piece is selected, images of that piece are shown instead of all thumbnails.
