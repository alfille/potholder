## Setup

Just give us:

* List of users

Minor, the incremental cost of additional server level

## Support

This is a collaborative humanitarian project. We're glaad to help you get started. The "administrator" has a day job, however, and expects that once set up, support should be minimal. 

Help with documenting usage, fixes, and "paying forward" by helping new users would be appreciated.
