# Notes

Like any medical record, notes allow for flexible documentation of the patient's condition and progress.

In eMission, notes can contain free-form text and pictures.

Notes also have:

* An associated patient (of course)
* A date (you can edit it, but otherwise the current date is used)
* A category (e.g. Pre-op, Anesthesia, Followup, etc)
