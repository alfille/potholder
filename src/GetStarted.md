# Getting Started with eMission

## Get an invitation

There is nothing to install -- just a web page in your browser (like *Edge*, *Chrome*, *Safari*, *Firefox*, ...)

You will receive the address, user name, database name and password from your mission leader.

Possible ways are:

* An email or letter like this:

* A text with the QR code

* If you don't get a link, visit https://emissionsystem.org and you will get a chance to [enter the information directly](RemoteDatabaseInput.html).

## Get the medical records

This is automatic (but may take a little while)

The *Sync status* will show the current state of data transfer. *quiescent* when complete.

## What next?

You are all set to start working with __eMission__ -- for instance [All Patients](AllPatients.html) will take you to a list of patients.

## Coming back

How do you get back to __eMission__ the next time?

A local copy of the program and data stays in your browser. You can get back to it by:

* Keeping the browser tab open, or
* Reopening the tab in any of these ways:
  * Add to favorites
  * Look in your browser history
  * Click on the original invitation again
