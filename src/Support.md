# Support and Maintenance

The hope is that __eMission__ will find broad usefulness and support humanitarian efforts throughout the world. So how can you get started or solve problems?

## Setup

The authors are happy to help with initial setup (although there are very [comprehensive instructions](server.html) included).

## Maintainance

We have found maintainance needs to be small.

* Physical infrastructure
  * Server is either a cloud service or a fairly standard desktop-type computer. 
  * Clients are phones or other portable devices that users already own and maintain.
* Software
  * All software components are stable and free. Routine security upgrades of computers should be done.
* Data
  * We recommend backups -- which are easy via [replication](replication.html)
  * Each portable device also contains a replica of it's mission data
* Users
  * Adding and managing users should be a small part of typical mission support.mathjax
