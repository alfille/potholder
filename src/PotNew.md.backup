Creating an entry for a ne piece is easy. Only a little information is needed, and defaults are used for _date_ and _artist_.

For _type_ and _series_ a list of previous entries are offered, since the choice is often a repeat.

The _date_ defaults to the urrent date, and an elegant date picker can be used to change it.

Finally remember to _Save Changes_.
