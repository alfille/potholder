# Grouped List

![](ListGroup.png)

Rather than one long list, your pieces can be listed by _Groups_ like "Clay", "Glaze", "Series", "Firing", etc. The available choices are seen in the [_List Menu_](ListMenu.md).

### Groups

### Separate Lists

Each group is a separate table. You can select a piece to inspect or edit by clicking on it's row in the table.

### Hiding Tables
