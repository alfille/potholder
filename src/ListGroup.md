# Grouped List

![](ListGroup.png)

Rather than one long list, your pieces can be listed by _Groups_ like "Clay", "Glaze", "Series", "Form", "Stage", etc. The available choices are seen in the [_List Menu_](ListMenu.md).

### Groups

![](ListGroup1.png)

You can see this grouping is by "Clay," and the name of each clay found is shown.

### Collapse Groups

The "__-__" and "__+__" buttons can collase and expand all the groups to make it easier to get an overview.

It is possible to hide or show any of the tables by clicking the "+" "-" button.

### Separate Lists

Each group is a separate table. You can select a piece to inspect or edit by clicking on it's row in the table.

### Sortable

Like the [_All Pieces Table_](AllPieces.md), each table is sortable by clicking on a column heading.

### Repeats

Depending on the grouping, pieces can appear in more than one category.
