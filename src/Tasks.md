Once you get familiar with eMission, you will find all the tasks intuitive.

* Each page has **Help** to jump to a detailed description
* The layout and presentation is [consistent](Layout.html)

To get you started, a couple of common tasks are presented in detail. You can go through the steps in order, using the right and left arrow on the side of the pages.

* [Create a new patient](AddPatient.html)
* [Add a note and/or picture](NoteEdit.html)

The **right** and **left** arrow keys can also be used to move through the pages sequentially.
