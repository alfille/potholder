# Hosted or physical

The **eMission** server needs to be publically acceesible from the internet with a known *address* (either fixed IP address or DNS entry).

Organizations with dedicated IT staff and resources may find it easiest (and more in keeping with insitutional policy) to host the server internally. The required hardware resources are small and ongoing management minimal.

Quite possibly, your volunteer organization will not have an existing infrastructure and will want to out-source server provisioning and management. The advantages are:

* Minimal startup cost
* Predictable ongoing cost
* Easy termination
* Vendor manages physical assets, backups and networking
